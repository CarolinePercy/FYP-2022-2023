The Cityscapes Panoptic Parts Dataset
-------------------------------------

Cityscapes Panoptic Parts extends the original Cityscapes annotations (train fine and val sets) with part-level semantics. It contains manual annotations for 23 part-level classes corresponding to 5 scene-level things classes from the original Cityscapes dataset.

The license agreement for the original Cityscapes images and labels can be found in the section "The Cityscapes Dataset" below. The extension containing only the part-level annotations, is referred to as the "Extended dataset" and is covered by the following agreement:

The Extended dataset comes "AS IS" without express or implied warranty. This Extended dataset is made freely available to academic and non-academic entities for non-commercial purposes. Permission is granted to use the data given that you agree:
1. To include a reference to the Extended dataset in any work that makes use of the dataset.
2. Not to distribute the Extended dataset or modified versions. It is permissible to distribute derivative works in as far as they are abstract representations of this dataset and do not allow to recover the Extended dataset or something similar in character.
3. That we (Cityscapes Panoptic Parts team and the Mobile Perception Systems lab of the Eindhoven University of Technology) are not liable for any misuse of the content and all rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by us.
